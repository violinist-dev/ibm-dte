At its core then, zero-based budgeting is about agility. And getting companies to run in a more cost-efficient way to make them more competitive. A common mistake that occurs when it comes to unleashing cost-cutting: Piecemeal approaches focused mainly on overhead and cost of goods sold.\n\nThese efforts only scratch the surface and risk causing the company to lose valuable, differentiating capabilities. Companies need to focus on their core goals; funds that are not working towards those goals should be shifted into activities that drive growth. Zero-based budgeting can help performance: it is a way to assist with driving growth. Indeed, without zero-based budgeting it’s likely the money needed to grow just wouldn’t be there."
